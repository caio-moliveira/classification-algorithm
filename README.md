## Introduction
Network systems are a combination of hardware and software used for various network transactions. Firewall systems control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to detect unauthorized access. Machine learning algorithms have been applied in various real-world problems and may outperform classical network systems in preventing unauthorized internet access.

Firewall log activities require analysis to determine exactly what is allowed, dropped, and denied. It is not easy due to working with large raw data collected from the Internet Access Management in different periods of time. Firewall log files can generate a high volume of data, and the systems used can be outdated.

The main goal of this assignment is to use Machine Learning models to analyze network traffic datasets. The utilized models include Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). The model aims to predict the recommended action to be taken for each session as traffic flows through the network. After applying the models, we assessed the performance of the classifiers in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score
